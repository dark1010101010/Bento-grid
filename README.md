## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size

> Note: I mostly stuck with the original design, but faced some issues with fonts and grid sizing. I also used Flexbox along with Grid where needed.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5
- CSS
- CSS Grid
- Flexbox

### What I learned

Working on this challenge helped me improve my layout skills, especially:

- How to use **CSS Grid** and **Flexbox** together
- Better understanding of **positioning and alignment** using grids

Hereâ€™s a simple example I practiced with:

```css
.grid-container {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 1fr);
  gap: 20px;
}

.flex-item {
  display: flex;
  align-items: center;
  justify-content: center;
}
```

### Continued development

> In future projects, I want to:

- Improve my grid layout skills
- Learn how to make sites fully responsive

- This project was only designed for a fixed screen size, and I want to improve responsiveness going forward.

### Useful resources

- ChatGPT (for guidance and troubleshooting)

- YouTube videos on CSS Grid
